## 📖 Usage

Here’s how to use **`csvParseBig`** to process your CSV files.

// Create an instance of the parser with the CSV file path and options
const parser = new csvBig('path/to/largefile.csv', {
    outputFilePath: 'output.json',
    maxLines: 1000,
    delimiter: ','
});

// Extract the first lines
parser.extractFirstLines(10).then((records) => {
    console.log('📄 First 10 records:', records);
});

// Extract lines that meet certain conditions
parser.extractWhere([
    { attribute: 'status', filter: value => value === 'active' }
], 50).then((records) => {
    console.log('✅ Filtered records:', records);
});
```
